description = """\
Analyzes 15N constant-time TROSY CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments for
measurement of Î”D NH in protein systems undergoing millisecond-time-scale
exchange dynamics. Resulting magnetization intensity after the CPMG block is
calculated using the 12x12, two spin matrix:

[ Nx(a), Ny(a), Nz(a), HzNx(a), HzNy(a), HzNz(a),
  Nx(b), Ny(b), Nz(b), HzNx(b), HzNy(b), HzNz(b) ]

This version is modified such that CPMG pulses are applied with [0013] phase
cycle.  Off resonance effects are taken into account. The calculation is designed
specifically to analyze the experiment found in the reference:"""
