description = """\
Analyzes 15N constant-time TROSY CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments for
measurement of Î”D NH in protein systems undergoing millisecond-time-scale
exchange dynamics. Resulting magnetization intensity after the CPMG block is
calculated using the 12x12, two spin matrix:

[ Nx(a), Ny(a), Nz(a), 2HzNx(a), 2HzNy(a), 2HzNz(a),
  Nx(b), Ny(b), Nz(b), 2HzNx(b), 2HzNy(b), 2HzNz(b),
  Nx(c), Ny(c), Nz(c), 2HzNx(c), 2HzNy(c), 2HzNz(c) ]
  
Off resonance effects are taken into account. The calculation is designed
specifically to analyze the experiment found in the reference:"""
