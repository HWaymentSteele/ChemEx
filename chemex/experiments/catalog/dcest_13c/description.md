# 13C Pure In-phase D-CEST

Analyzes chemical exchange in the presence of 1H composite decoupling during
the D-CEST block. This keeps the spin system purely in-phase throughout, and
is calculated using the (3n)Ã—(3n), single-spin matrix, where n is the number
of states:

    { Ix(a), Iy(a), Iz(a),
      Ix(b), Iy(b), Iz(b), ... }
