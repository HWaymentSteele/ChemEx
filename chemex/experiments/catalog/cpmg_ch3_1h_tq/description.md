# 1H (Methyl-13CH3) Triple-Quantum Proton CPMG

Measures methyl proton chemical exchange recorded on site-specifically
13CH3-labeled proteins in a highly deuterated background. Magnetization
is initially anti-phase and is read out as anti-phase. The calculation
uses a simplified scheme that includes only (6n)Ã—(6n) basis set,
two-spin matrix, where n is the number of states:

    { 2HTQxCz(a), 2HTQyCz(a), 2HzCz(a), HTQx(a), HTQy(a), Hz(a),
      2HTQxCz(b), 2HTQyCz(b), 2HzCz(b), HTQx(b), HTQy(b), Hz(b), ... }
